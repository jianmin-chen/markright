            const markdown = `If you don't already know, I recently decided to rebuild my blog. Previously, I had used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby tool designed for writing blogs and their [default theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for GitHub Pages with a couple of tweaks. This time, I decided to build a blog application myself - one that would allow me to:

* Write blog articles on the site and send emails, i.e., kind of like an admin panel
* Posts vs. complete articles for quick updates
* One with my own custom design

Ultimately, I decided to switch over because there were some limitations with the previous blog and I wanted to get rid of those limitations. I was also inspired by [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)'s blog, which was written with very similar tools. Most importantly, I really just wanted to get some practice building a NextJS full-stack app, since there definitely are tools out there that could get rid of the aforementioned limitations.

---

## The design

The first thing I did was build a static design. Here's a quick snippet of the SCSS:

\`\`\`scss
#blog-wrapper {
    /* Flexbox wrapper for entire website */
    @media screen and (min-width: $min-width) {
        display: flex;
        position: relative;

        #nav {
            flex-basis: 0;
            flex-grow: 3;
        }

        #blog {
            flex-basis: 0;
            flex-grow: 9;
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

I spent a pretty long time tweaking the styles to get the site looking the way I wanted, but it came out pretty great. (I hope.) One of the issues I ran into was styling images:

![A picture of the Golden Gate Bridge that I took! Pretty nice, eh?](https://jianminchen.com/assets/images/2022-07-28-rebuilding-this-blog/goldengatebridge.webp)

I realized that I wanted to add captions to images, but ultimately I would be writing content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), just like I had done with Jekyll. In HTML, the images would look like this:

\`\`\`html
<div class="image">
    <image src="/assets/images/goldengatebridge.webp">
    <em>A picture of the Golden Gate Bridge that I took! Pretty nice, eh?</em>
</div>
\`\`\`

While Markdown does let you include HTML, I didn't want to write this every time I wanted to use an image. There's a solution to this: the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) library. According to the main page of the project site:

> MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. ðŸš€

With the MDX library, I could turn the HTML above into a component:

\`\`\`js
export default {
    img: ({ src, alt }) => (
        <span className="image">
            <img src={src} />
            <em>{alt}</em>
        </span>
    )
};
\`\`\`

The only downside of this was that I couldn't use NextJS's image optimization for local images. (If you know, please do let me know. I'm sure I could write a hacky solution, but I don't want to.) Besides, I needed to figure out to add links to headings as well, so I went ahead and did that. Try hovering over the headings!

## Content

Once I finished the design of the different pages, I started working on logic. All the code for this website is located at a personal GitHub [repo](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/blog). In it, I have a file called \`generate.js\` that is responsible for reading the content inside a folder called \`_content\`, which contains:

* Articles
* Main pages

The difference between these is that articles are viewed through the article pages, while main pages are included in the menu bar - for example, my [resume](/resume).

\`generate.js\` also takes care of generating unique slugs - that is, unique routes for each article so article routes don't overlap. These are then used by NextJS' [\`getStaticProps\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) to cache content, thus making loading article content more efficient.

## Newsletter and backend implementation

I also decided to implement a newsletter. This was one of the aforementioned drawbacks of using Jekyll, where I had to create a separate Flask app to store and view subscribers. This new newsletter points to \`/api/subscribe\`, which in turn updates a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas, both tools that were on my learning list earlier this year. MongoDB was utilized for managing nearly everything on the backend, which I did through an admin interface that I also had to create. I planned for this admin interface to let me:

* View and delete subscribers
* View and send newsletters

The backend was implemented with a few tools: \`nodemailer\` for sending the mail (through my personal domain email, *jianmin[at]jianminchen.com*), \`mongoose\` for modeling subscribers and admins in the database, and \`chakra-ui/@react\` so I wouldn't have to write SCSS for the backend (although adapting for mobile was a burden, but oh well).

## Conclusion

After wrapping the code part up, I decided to do a couple of extra things:

* Utilize SEO
* Test with NextJS' \`core-web-vitals\` to ensure everything was as optimized as I could possibly make it
* Use \`depcheck\` to make sure there are no unnecessary dependencies

Overall, it was a lot of fun building this! It was genuinely a great learning experience.`;
